# DecentraDoc

### DecentraDoc is a decentralized word documentation application 
DecentraDoc is an open source, real time, collaborative text editor built from scratch using Reactjs,Web socket and Solidity

## Idea

Having used text editors like Google Docs, how it worked under the hood has always piqued our interest. Suprisingly, Googling how these text editors work yield no results. They keep their unique software a closely guarded secret. The idea is to decentralise office documents, for the hackathon we worked on a decentralised text editor to collaborate on documents and to solve the issue of privacy encroachment.

## Challenges
- Connection to IPFS
 We had issues trying to plug into the decentralised web3 storage.

- Syncing of texts
We also had issues syncing the texts on multiple screens.

## What we learned

We came across a lot of new Web3 terminologies. This project gave us a conceptual understanding of IPFS and connecting it with standing technologies. We certainly got to know a lot about different dependencies, some of which we never even heard of like HTTP client, IPFS and Web3 storage.

Integrating this project was one of the biggest challenges we faced and so we learned a lot from it. The connection to IPFS gave us a huge headache but when we were able to successfully get results , it gave us the same amount of relief.

After making this project, we gained confidence in our own capacity to lead, listen and make the best decision. The most significant thing we learnt was how to write smart contracts, of course.
